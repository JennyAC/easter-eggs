    <title>Easter Egg Painting at the Hodgkin&quot;s - FAQ</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>What is the day all about?</h2>
            <p>
                Originally this was a day when the Hodgkin family painted eggs as part of their celebration of Easter
                Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays the Hodgkin family is more like a clan or a tribe than anything else and it's a chance for
                family and friends to get together paint eggs, socialise, eat and be merry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Who can come along?</h2>
            <p>
                Generally, all are welcome, but to keep numbers manageable you must be invited by a family member
                (however loosely defined) and have confirmed to that person that you are coming. Within reason your
                partner and children if any are welcome as well, but please let us know numbers so that we can cater
                accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children are welcome to decorate eggs, and a separate table is provided for young children. It seems to
                work well if the children have their turn when they first arrive and then parents afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting takes place in a family home so there is a limit to how many we can accommodate, but if
                you have RSVPd to an invitation it should be fine.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What will be expected of us?</h2>
            <p>That you have a good time!</p>
            <p>Remember, you are guests in a private home so please behave in a courteous and respectful manner.</p>
            <p>
                If you bring young children you are responsible for their care, we cannot offer childminding facilities,
                so please consider yourself responsible for your children's safety and behaviour at all times. We know
                that it is hard to not focus on your creative endeavours to the exclusion of all else, but really it's
                up to you to arrange for someone (your long suffering partner? take it in turns with a friend?) to
                arrange for suitable supervision for your children.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a strong expectation that you will paint at least one egg. There are a small number of
                curmudgeonly people who do not do this, but you can at least expect to be on the receiving end of some
                social pressure to conform.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What will be provided?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs to paint (chicken eggs, as white as we can manage) at least one, probably two= or more.</li>
                <li>Paints, dyes, pencils, textas etc.</li>
                <li>
                    Brushes (basic quality - some people bring artist quality brushes but please do not use them without
                    asking their owner. If you're not sure which ones are OK to use, just ask.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some sort of light meal (almost certainly involving scrambled eggs and toast). We try to cater to
                    vegetarians and gluten sensitive people. If you have special requirements let us know, but if they
                    are complex or seriously life threatening it might be best to bring your own food.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Will alcohol be served?</h2>
            <p>
                No. You may bring some wine, beer or cider to consume in moderation if you like, but moderation is the
                key word. No alcohol may be provided to or consumed by minors
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I smoke?</h2>
            <p>Only if you go outside, and far enough away that you won't bother anyone else.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What about other drugs?</h2>
            <p>No illicit or illegal drugs are to be brought to this event.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What can I bring?</h2>
            <p>
                You don't need to bring anything! We're happy to just have you come along, but if you want to
                contribute the following are always welcome:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    White eggs - Chicken, Ducks, Geese, Emus, Ostriches, whatever if you have some spare they are always
                    welcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chocolate Easter Eggs / Bunnies / Bilbies (or carob, marshmallow or icing) - absolutely not
                    required, but if you really want to...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other snacks / non alcoholic drinks
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I take my painted egg(s) home?</h2>
            <p>
                Of course! The family is prepared to store up to 2 eggs if you wish. If you do leave eggs behind they
                may be put on display from time to time - either in the family home or possibly in a public location.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is it OK to take pictures?</h2>
            <p>
                As a general rule yes. Some people may prefer not to be included in picture, please respect their wishes.
            </p>
            <p>Please do not take pictures of other people's children with asking them first.</p>
            <p>Please do not share pictures of anyone else to any form of social media without their permission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <h2>Are there any other activities?</h2>
                <p>
                    There probably will be an easter egg hunt for the younger children.  Your children will be welcome
                    to take part if we know that we're coming, but be aware that they will probably want to eat any aggs
                    they find.  If they are allergic to chocolate or dairy or anything else in the eggs that we hide you
                    should probably bring something you can swap them for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There may be other children's activities, but then again, there may not.  Be prepared to entertain
                    your children as necessary to allow other people to concentrate on their eggs.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember the day is about enjoying a social activity and unleashing your creativity. Be considerate of other
        people and have fun!
